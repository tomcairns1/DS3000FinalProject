# DS3000FinalProject

This project investigates the physiological markers in shore birds that are most affected by exposure to oil. The data was collected from US Fish and Wildlife after the DeepWater Horizon spill in 2010. The data include different species and many different tests conducted on each bird. Machine learning techniques were used to identify the markers that were the most impacted by exposure to oil spills and a model was created to be able to predict if a bird had been exposed to oil based on these markers. 

Contains the dataset to be used in the final project
